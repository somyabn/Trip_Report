Introduction:
The app expects the input file “input.txt” in the root directory as argument to the script and generates driving history report “output.txt” at the root directory.
Since I am most comfortable in ruby , I have implemented the solution in the same and tested units using Rspec ( A ruby gem for unit testing).


Created Driver and Trip class  for modelleng the objects in the given problem.
I divided the problem into following parts:
Parsing input commands (driver_trip_parser.rb)  - fetch the commands in file line by line and parse into driver and trip instances.
Calculating driving history for each driver (driver_trip_stats.rb)
Generating Report for the calculated values for each driver. (driver_trip_report_generator.rb)


Project structure:
The root:Trip_Report folder:
Navigate here in terminal to run the script: ruby generate_driver_trips_report.rb "input.txt"
this should generate the "output.txt" in the same folder and also prints the report to console.

Tests are in  spec folder: created tests to test each class and the class methods.
Tests are added for edge cases like
1.Trip with average speed more than 100 and less than 5 is not coming on report.
2.The report is sorted with highest total miles driver report first.
to run tests go to root folder run following commands:
gem install 'rspec'
rspec spec


Rspec gem is listed in gemfile , to install the same , run command gem install 'rspec'
